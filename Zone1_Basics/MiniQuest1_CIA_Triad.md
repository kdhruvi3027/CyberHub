# 🏰 MiniQuest 1: The Village of Infocyte – CIA Triad

Welcome, Apprentice Guardian! 🌟  
Before you can defend the digital realm, you must master the **CIA Triad** — the foundation of all cybersecurity.  

## 🔹 Step 1: Learn the Basics

The **CIA Triad** consists of three pillars:

1. **Confidentiality (C)**  
   - Keeps information **secret and safe** from unauthorized access.  
   - Example: Passwords, personal data, secret plans.  

2. **Integrity (I)**  
   - Ensures information **cannot be tampered with** or altered without permission.  
   - Example: Bank transactions must not be changed by hackers.  

3. **Availability (A)**  
   - Makes sure information and systems are **accessible when needed**.  
   - Example: Websites, emails, or services that must be up and running.  

## 🔹 Step 2: Reflect with Simple Examples

- **Confidentiality:** Imagine a locked chest only you have the key to.  
- **Integrity:** A diary where pages cannot be changed by anyone else.  
- **Availability:** A bridge that must always stay open so travelers can cross.  

## 🔹 Step 3: Tools & Protections

Here are some basic tools used by Cyber Guardians:

| Tool/Method           |         Purpose                                                     |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Encryption (AES, RSA) | Protects **confidentiality** of data                                |
| Hashing (SHA-256)     | Maintains **integrity** of files and messages                       |
| Firewalls & Anti-DDoS | Ensures **availability** of systems                                 |
| Access Controls       | Limits who can see or change data (**confidentiality & integrity**) |

> These are just the beginner shields. As you advance, more powerful tools will appear in your journey! 🛡️

## 🔹 Step 4: Your Mission

1. Understand each pillar of the CIA Triad.  
2. Remember the examples and tools.  
3. Be ready to face your first **real-world breach cases** in the next mini-quest.
