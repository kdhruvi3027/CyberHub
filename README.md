## 🌍 The Story
In the vast world of the Internet, hidden shadows called **Threats** try to steal secrets, corrupt data, and bring systems to their knees.  
The **Cyber Guardians**, a group of skilled defenders, protect this realm using knowledge, logic, and powerful tools.

You, the new **Apprentice Guardian**, have just entered training.  
Your mission: master every zone of cybersecurity, uncover hidden cases, and level up your skills until you can face the **Dark Breach**, a mysterious entity attacking the digital world.

## 🗺️ How the Game Works
Each **Zone** = a new level of knowledge

As you complete mini-quests, you earn **XP** and unlock new “Shades of Power” (skills):
- 💠 *Shade of Confidentiality*  
- 💠 *Shade of Integrity*  
- 💠 *Shade of Availability*  
- and many more as you advance
